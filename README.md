# Django Advanced Course Practice

This repository contains my personal practice and code snippets while following the **[Build a Backend REST API with Python & Django - Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/)** course on Udemy.

## About

This is **not** an original project. It's built strictly for educational purposes as I work through the above course.  
All code, structure, and logic are based on the instructions provided in the course materials.

## Purpose

- Reinforce advanced Django concepts
- Practice real-world patterns and tools
- Track personal progress while learning
